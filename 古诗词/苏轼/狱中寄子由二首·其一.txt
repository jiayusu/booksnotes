圣主如天万物春，小臣愚暗自亡身。
百年未满先偿债，十口无归更累人。
是处青山可埋骨，他年夜雨独伤神。
与君世世为兄弟，来生更结未了因。
The monarch reigns, his splendor nurturing all, yet in folly, I have faltered.
Life not full spent, my past debts call, leaving kin to carry burdens once shouldered.
In death, 'neath any verdant hill is rest, whilst in night rain, my brother mourns, isolated.
In the next life, may we brothers be, resolving ties once fatefully created."
